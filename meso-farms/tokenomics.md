{% hint style="info" %}
"The best performing tokens need to start with 70%+ of the emission going to the native token liquidity and staking" Quoted from [https://rugdoc.io/education/yield-farm-jetfuel/](https://rugdoc.io/education/yield-farm-jetfuel/)\
For us its 75%\~ 
{% endhint %}



## Deposit Fees:

* Deposit fees are capped at 4% to avoid inadvertent changes.
  * Native pools - **0%**
  * Stablecoin single pools - **2.5%**
  * ERC20 single pools - **3%**
  * LP farms - 2**%**
* Deposit fees will be spent for future development work (salaries, infrastructure costs, etc.), audits/reviews/KYC, and buy backs (if necessary).
* Deposit fees will be sent to our multi-signature wallet for additional security and to avoid as well misspending of project funds.
* For Ice (Iron Finance) all Ice will be sent back to Polygon and converted to BlueIce. All USDC earned would be either used for buyback or for our profit vault.
