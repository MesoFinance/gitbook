# How to go to another chain?

### Setting things

First, you would need to set up your Metamask wallet to the corresponding network that you would like to participate in. Here are several guides from each chain's official documentation:

* [Fantom Opera Mainnet](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask)
* [Cronos Mainnet](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/getting-started/metamask.html#connecting-to-the-cronos-mainnet-beta)

Once your Metamask has been set up, you can now connect to our website and start investing in your desired chain!
