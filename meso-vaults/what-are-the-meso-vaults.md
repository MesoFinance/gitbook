# What are the Meso Vaults?

The Meso vaults are auto-compounding stakes on third party protocols. The project acts as an intermediary to automatically manage the user's funds on their behalf by harvesting the rewards and staking it back as the same invested asset.

The vaults will be charging a 0-4% fee on the harvested rewards. Vaults are compounded automatically depending on tvl for cost-efficiency.
