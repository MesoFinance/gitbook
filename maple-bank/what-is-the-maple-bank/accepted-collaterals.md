# Accepted Collaterals

MUSD can only be made through locking collateral to back its value - either through approved collateral in vaults or through Anchor. Collateral can be static tokens like LINK, CRV, and others. It can also be exotic assets like Beefy and Yearn strategies. Interest-bearing collateral like Beefy, Yearn, and Aave receipt tokens allow users to accumulate yield from their collateral while it's deposited in MUSD vaults.
